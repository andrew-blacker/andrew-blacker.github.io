<h1>A Brief History/Overview of Nintendo </h1>
<hr>

<p> Nintendo is a Japanese multimedia company that is well known for its many iconic video games, characters, and consoles.
<br>  
<br> 
Originally founded in 1889, Nintendo began as a trading card, however, through the years it has transitioned into primarily producing video games in addition to home and handheld consoles. While other companies have come and gone, Nintendo has consistently been a main competitor in their industry since its breakout in the 1970s.
